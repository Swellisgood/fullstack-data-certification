Kayak wants to build a recommendation app for users to help them plan their next vacation. The app will query a data lake to find the best destinations in France based on weather information for the last 7 days from Booking.com and display a map of them to the user. The app will also display the top 20 hotel recommendations in those destinations based on rankings on booking.com.
